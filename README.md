## ✨ Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎧 **Your music** | Add your own files and they stay in the app's storage between launches. Open audio files with milo. straight from your desktop. |
| 🌐 **Stream** | YouTube Music catalogue, 30-second iTunes previews and live radio. |
| 🧠 **Music intelligence** | Autoplay queues songs like the one playing, using artist, genre, tempo, energy, what you like and what you skip. Tempo and energy are analysed on-device. When online it also uses similar artists from iTunes, Deezer and YouTube. Every song menu has **Start radio**. |
| 🎤 **Karaoke lyrics** | On desktop, Now Playing fills the current line word by word in time with the music. Lyrics come from SimpMusic Lyrics, LRCLIB and BetterLyrics (timed). |
| 🖥️ **Immersive desktop** | Full-bleed art (or the YouTube video) behind the player, spectrum visualiser, wide middle panel. |
| 📜 **Queue and lists** | The playing song is highlighted everywhere, with a jump pill to scroll back to it. Glass pop-ups throughout. |
| 📊 **YouTube extras** | SimpMusic weekly charts, SponsorBlock skips, Return YouTube Dislike counts. |
| ☁️ **Cloud sync** | Optional Supabase sync with row-level security, each person sees only their own data. |
| 👤 **Accounts** | Sign-up screen on launch, then your profile card and the terms (versioned, must be accepted). Playlists, likes, history and settings sync across devices. |
| 🤝 **Friends** | Add people by username, see their shared playlists and what they're listening to. Friends get the *song DNA* (title, artist, source link), never your files, and it opens by streaming. |
| 💬 **Disappearing chat** | 5 MB per chat, messages vanish after 24 hours, oldest are removed when the limit is reached. |
| 🌍 **Languages and data saver** | English, Zulu, Swahili, Afrikaans, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, Arabic (right-to-left), plus a data-light mode. |
| 🚗 **Car mode, lyric translation** | Big-button driving screen; translate lyrics line by line. |
| 📺 **Smart TV** | Samsung Tizen and LG webOS packages, TV mode switches on automatically. |

```

## 🚀 Install

An installable web app must be served over **https** (or `localhost`).

1. Put the whole folder on any static host: [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop), GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages or Vercel.
2. Open the https address, then:

| Device | How |
|---|---|
| Android (Chrome, Edge) | Menu → **Install app** |
| iPhone / iPad | Safari → Share → **Add to Home Screen** |
| Desktop Chrome / Edge | Install icon at the right of the address bar |

Try it locally first:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080   # then open http://localhost:8080
```

> **Updating:** after editing `index.html`, bump the version in `sw.js` (`milo-v79` → `milo-v78`) so installed copies refresh. An installed app may need one extra restart to pick it up.

For the Play Store, Microsoft Store or App Store, upload your hosted address to [pwabuilder.com](https://pwabuilder.com).

## 🔧 Configure

**Accounts, sync, friends and chat (Supabase)**
1. Run `supabase-setup.sql` once in the Supabase SQL editor. It creates the sync table, profiles, friends, shared data and chat, all with row-level security.
2. In Supabase > Authentication > Providers > Email, **turn off "Confirm email"** so people can go straight from sign-up to their profile card. (If it stays on, they must click the email link first.)
3. The Supabase anon key in `index.html` is meant to be public. Row-level security protects the data.
4. Have a lawyer review the terms text (`TERMS_HTML` in `index.html`) before a public launch. Bump `TERMS_V` when you change them to make everyone accept again.

**YouTube**
The YouTube Data API key in `index.html` is visible to anyone. In Google Cloud Console, restrict it to *YouTube Data API v3* and to your site's HTTP referrers so nobody else spends your quota.

> Hosted previews (like a shared claude.ai page) block outside connections. Cloud sync and YouTube work in the installed or self-hosted app.

## 📺 Smart TVs

Samsung Tizen and LG webOS packages live in `milo-tv/`; see `milo-tv/README-TV.txt`. TV mode turns on by itself in TV browsers, or use Profile → Insights & tools → TV mode, or add `?tv=1` to the address.

## 🛟 Troubleshooting

- **No Install option?** Open it from https or localhost, not from a file or a chat preview link. Profile → Install milo. tells you which case you're in.
- Keep `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `icons/` and `splash/` next to `index.html`.
- **Android Chrome:** reload once after the first visit.
- **iPhone / iPad:** use Safari, not Chrome.

## 📱 Native apps

milo. detects whether it runs in a browser, an installed web app, an Android WebView (Web2APK) or Capacitor, and turns on storage protection, back-button handling, screen-on while playing and the native share / save sheets where they exist. See [NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md) for the Capacitor setup and what still needs native code.
